Full Name:

== Auto-marking ==:

_ I never received a report file. (Unittest is already posted on Piazza, run it before you submit with this option)
	Date/Time file was submitted:

_ I have a report file, but I cannot see my mark on MarkUs.

_ I believe that there is a problem with the automarker
	Test case name:
	Text copied from automarker:
	Explanation of why you think this is incorrect:

_ There has been a calculation error (the mark shown does not reflect the mark given in the report file/on MarkUs).
    Mark I believe I should have received:

_ I name my file wrong. (Penalty applied) *
    Note: This option has 10% overall deduction.

_ I name my class/method/function(s) wrong. (Penalty applied) *
    Note: This option has 10% automarking deduction per name change. (Others that calls this class/method/function is also changed)
    Required name:
    Your class/method/function name:

_ I would like to request for code change. (Penalty applied) *
    Note: You may add/delete/replace up to __2__ lines, results in 10% automarking deduction per line change.
    Please use the following format: (delete the example before submit your request)
        add: line ###: m = 1
        delete: line ###
        replace: line ###: n = 1

_ The report indicates that my code has invalid byte error(s). (Penalty applied) *
    Note: This option has 10% automarking deduction per correction, up to 30% deduction in total (no correction limit).
        That is, if 3+ corrections required, all of them will be corrected and your total automarking deduction is 30%.
            SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x## in position #
            UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x## in position #
    Line number(s):

_ I used some data types that are restricted from the handout. (Penalty applied) *
    Note: This option has 50% automarking deduction.
        If none of the options above solve the issue, then use this option.

_ Others. (To be discussed with the instructor, penalty may apply) *
    Briefly describe your issue:
    Your possible solution:


*   If you request to re-run automarker, we will take the second result as the final automarking mark.
    Namely, we do not take the maximum, and your new automarking grade (and deduction) might be lower than original grade.
**  You may select multiple options, the deduction will be calculated separately.

*** Make your decision wisely.


== Manual Marking ==:

_ I believe the marking scheme was incorrectly applied.
	The following are a list of sections where I believe the marking scheme was incorrectly applied,
	and an explanation of what I believe to be wrong (one section per line)
	
	Example: (please delete this example before submit your request)
	Internal Comments - I have comments in my entire file, but I received a commenting mark of 0/2
