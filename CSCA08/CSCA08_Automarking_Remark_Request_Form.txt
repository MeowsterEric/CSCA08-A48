Instruction:
You may add/delete/change up to 2 lines, results in 10% automarker deduction per line.
Please email me which line(s) you would like to add/delete/change, use the following format.
	i.e: add: line ###: m = 1
	i.e: delete: line ###
	i.e: change: line ###: replace to: n = 1



If you did not receive automarking report, most likely your code has infinite loop.
Check the code yourself, and send me the line change request. Penalty applied as described above.

If you submitted the file with wrong filename, please indicate in the email.
I will manually correct your filename and re-run it. This one has 10% Automarking mark deduction.

Again, you are only allowed to change up to 2 lines, and your mark might be lower than original. Be aware.
