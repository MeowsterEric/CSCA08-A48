<CSCA48 Remark: Assignment __#__> - <__UTORid__>

------------------------------
Full Name:
MarkUs Username (UTORid):

Please put a X beside the reason for this remark request, and complete the related fields:


== Auto-marking ==:

_ I never received a report file.
	Date/Time file was submitted:

_ I have a report file, but I cannot see my mark on MarkUs.

_ I believe that there is a problem with the automarker
	Test case name:
	Text copied from automarker:
	Explanation of why you think this is incorrect:

_ There has been a calculation error (the mark shown does not reflect the mark given in the report file/on MarkUs).
    Mark I believe I should have received:

_ I named my file wrong. (Penalty applied)
    Note: I will manually correct your filename and re-run the automarker. This request has 10% global deduction.

_ I would like to request for code change with penalty applied to my submission. (Penalty applied)
    Note: You may add/delete/replace up to __2__ lines, results in 10% automarking deduction per line.
    Please use the following format: (please delete the examples before submit your request)
        add: line ###: m = 1
        delete: line ###
        replace: line ###: n = 1

If you request to re-run automarker, we will take the second result as the final automarking mark.
Namely, we do not take the maximum of the 2 marks, and your new automarking grade might be lower than original grade.


== Manual Marking ==:

_ I believe the marking scheme was incorrectly applied.
	The following are a list of sections where I believe the marking scheme was incorrectly applied,
	and an explanation of what I believe to be wrong (one section per line)
	
	Example: (please delete this example before submit your request)
	Internal Comments - I have comments in my entire file, but I received a commenting mark of 0/2
