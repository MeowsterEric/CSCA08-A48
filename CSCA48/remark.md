CSCA48-S17 Assignment 1 Special Remark Request
---------------
If you've made a silly mistake that caused you lots of marks, we (mostly Brian) want to give you an opportunity to redeem yourself.
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY! You only have one chance to submit the request.

### Here are the rules
+ You get _**up to 5 lines**_ to change anywhere in your submission with whatever **(max) 80 characters** (an entire replacement line). 
+ Each line you change results in an immediate **10% auto-mark deduction**.
+ Please ensure that you have the right line numbers, and that your code is _**exactly**_ as it should appear on that line **(with appropriate indentation)**.
+ Please keep in mind that this is a mostly automated process! So any changes must be precise as it could actually crash your entire code. For example:
    + improperly indented code, 
    + non-UTF8 characters,
    + using 4 space tabs (when you were using actual tabs)
    + etc.
+ If not properly formatted, it could **lose even more marks**. So you really want to be careful here. If this happens and it's not our fault, you will have no recourse.
+ The automated script will only read max 79 characters per line, after that everything is abruptly stripped, so this may cause problems if you try playing the system. This includes trying to fit multiple lines in one with new line characters. Don't do it.

### This form needs to be submitted before Sunday, July 30, 2017 @ 11:59PM EST.

#### This form can only be submitted once, and once submitted - IT CANNOT BE REVOKED!!
